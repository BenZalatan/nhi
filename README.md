Hey guys, this is the master folder for all of our individual code. 

### Current goal: create a unified document with all of our activities in it. The first step towards this is to create all of our user interface graphics. In the master.html file, I created a function called updateActivity(). This is called everytime the next button is pressed. I think it would be a good idea to get our UI and graphics up by the end of this week (6/7/19). In this function, go to the if statement that corresponds with your project and write a function to create the UI for your project. Next week, we can implement the functionality of our code. I did this for my project, Multi-block. If you want to see how it works, you can read my code in master.html and in main.js in the Multi-block folder. If you have any #questions you can text me (phone number below).

I guess I will list some coding standards here:
1. Place all images in the 'Images' folder
2. Please make a folder for your project when importing your files (such as Multi-block or Windows)
3. Use four spaces for an indent. I'm personally using four spaces as an indent because it is default in Visual Studio Code and because I prefer it (this is not solidified, let me know if you guys want me to change this)

Thanks,

Jack K
