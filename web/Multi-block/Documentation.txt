boxInformation - This is an OOP object to hold the information for the pixel calculations.

createButton - this is for button selecting and pressing.  

	       To use, write 'var button = new RectButton(x_position, y_position, height, width, action);'  "action" is supposed
	       to be a string describing the action of the button (this is custom made by you).  Once you create your button,
	       add '.on('pointerdown', yourFunction);' to the list of .on's in this file.  Add yourFunctionName() to where ever
	       you want and program its function.

	       When programming your functionality, make sure the first line of your function starts with 
	       'if(currentlySelectedButtonAction != 'yourAction') return;'  This makes sure that your button is pressed, and not
	       another button is pressed.  If you want to see some examples, look at the functions below.  If you have any other
	       questions, ask Jack Kellerk.
